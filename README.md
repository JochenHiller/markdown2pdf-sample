# Markdown to PDF - Sample

This repository contains a sample document how to easily convert a Markdown document into a good looking, comprehensive PDF document.

The conversion is based on Pandoc (www.pandoc.org), a Swiss Knife for document format handling. It is using MultiMarkdown (<https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/wiki>) as Markdown extension with more capabilities for structured documents with cross references, table of contents and much more.

The document itself will be converted to a PDF using simple build scripts. A Dockerfile will be provided to simplify the generation of PDF from every machine without needs for local installation of tools, like Pandoc or LaTeX.

For any feedback put issues here or provide any pull requests.

The document will be provided under Eclipse Public License 1.0. See [LICENSE].
